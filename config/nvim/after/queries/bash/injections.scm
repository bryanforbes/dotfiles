; NOTE: on neovim >= 0.12, you can use the multi node pattern instead of
; combining injections:
;
; ((comment)+ @injection.content
;   (#lua-match? @injection.content "^#USAGE ")
;   (#offset! @injection.content 0 7 0 1)
;   (#set! injection.language "kdl"))
;
; this is the preferred way as combined injections have multiple
; limitations:
