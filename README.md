Bryan Forbes Dot Files
======================

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. See my [prezto repo](https://github.com/bryanforbes/prezto) for my ZSH configuration (the installation script installs my ZSH settings from it).

Installation
------------

  curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryanforbes/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
