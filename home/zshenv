# Load order: 1st (always sourced for ALL shells: interactive, non-interactive, login, non-login)
# Purpose: Set environment variables and options that must be available everywhere
#
# This file should be kept light and fast. Anything that's slow or involves
# user interaction should go in zshrc.
#
# Startup sequence:
#   1. /etc/zshenv  (system-wide, always)
#   2. ~/.zshenv    (this file) ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
#   3. ~/.zprofile  (if login shell OR non-login command shell at SHLVL 1)
#   4. ~/.zshrc     (if interactive shell)

# Disable global zprofile, which messes with the path
unsetopt GLOBAL_RCS

# Ensure that a non-login, non-interactive shell has a defined environment.
